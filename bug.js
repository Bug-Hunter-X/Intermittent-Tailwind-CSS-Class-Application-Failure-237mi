I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  I had the correct import statement and configured the `tailwind.config.js` file properly.  The issue seems to be related to the order in which Tailwind classes are applied, or perhaps a conflict with another CSS framework or library.  After inspecting the generated CSS using my browser's developer tools, I noticed that some classes seemed to be overridden or not included at all.  This only happened in specific components or sections of my webpage. The application of the classes appeared random at times, but often followed a pattern of not applying classes after a certain point in the markup.
