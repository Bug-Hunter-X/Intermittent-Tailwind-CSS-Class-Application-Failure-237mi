The issue was resolved by carefully examining the order of CSS classes and the specificity of CSS selectors. It turned out that there were some conflicting CSS rules in a third-party library that were overriding the Tailwind classes in certain parts of the component. By adding more specific classes, adding `!important` where necessary, or adjusting the order of classes in the component, the Tailwind classes were prioritized and the expected styling was achieved.  In this specific instance, the issue was caused by a conflict with the `normalize.css` library. This can be handled by either adding more specific classes or ensuring that the Tailwind styles are applied *after* `normalize.css` in the `<head>`.  Also the use of `@layer` utilities can be useful to solve these issues.
