# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied to elements. The issue appears to be related to class ordering or potential conflicts with other CSS rules. The bug is intermittent and affects only specific sections of the webpage. This README provides details on reproducing the issue and a proposed solution.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the inconsistencies in Tailwind class application within the `bug.js` component.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing and restructuring the CSS to resolve potential conflicts and ensuring that Tailwind classes are applied in a way that takes precedence over other styles. See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
